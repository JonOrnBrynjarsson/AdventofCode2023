# AdventOfCode2023
The Advent of Code challenge is great way to practice problem solving, with every challenge being more difficult than the last one. 
Kudos to Eric Wastlhttp://was.tl/ for his work on this.

**This project is meant for practicing my Python coding skills.**

Having first heard of and practiced my coding on the 2020 version with C# and having amazing time doing so, although only getting 22 stars in the end :( 
Two years ago I changed to Phyton, as more and more of my work involves Python.
Those projects are however usually API calls and database read/write stuff.
Hence, continuing from last year, I am using this year competition to practice my Python. 

I only ask of you, not to laugh to hard when you see some of the solutions I employ :D
I am more thinking of this as a way to practice my problem solving and learn some coding skills, rather than to write the most optimize code possible, although I do try finding the shortest path to a solution. 

My scoring: (My accepted solution is no.)
		Part 1	Part 2
Day-1	21.361	68.116 The second part was hard!! Wow!
Day-2	32.384	31.407 Much easier than yeasterday'a problem

ps. When each problem becomes available, it is 5 in the morning here in Iceland and I am usually fast asleep :)  Hence, I will probably not score any higher than 20.000.
